# Introduction
This is the repository for integration guides/documentation for [DSB](https://www.dsb.no/)
<br>(Direktoratet for samfunnssikkerhet og beredskap / Direktoratet for samfunnssikkerhet og beredskap / The Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection)

Here you can find information and examples detailing the avenues we provide for integrations.

## Who is this for?

The code and examples here expects you to have some fundamental programming knowledge, but we try to keep it as simple as possible.
<br>Our goal is that it should be easy for programmers to follow, and possible for technically inclined users to use with a little effort.
